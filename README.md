# Data Structures & Algorithms

Just a repository to store implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms.
Each implementation will be done in C#, accompanied by an explanation of the DS/Algorithm, and drawings if applicable.

This is mainly for my personal use - practicing implementations, quickly brush up on DSA concepts, etc.
But feel free to look at the source code, fork it, etc.
