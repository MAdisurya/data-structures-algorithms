Explanation
----------------------------

"A tree is an undirected graph which satisfies any of the following
definitions:" - William Fiset

- An acyclic connected graph (meaning that there are no cycles)

- A connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges
(Every node has an edge connecting to its parent node, except for the root node)

- A graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.
(Vertices = nodes, meaning that each node only has one connection/path
to another node. If there are multiple, then that would assume that there is a
cycle - which breaks the first condition)

So what is a Binary Search Tree?

"A binary search tree is a binary tree that satisfies the BST invariant:
the left subtree has smaller elements and the right subtree has
larger elements." - William Fiset

This is so that we can perform a more optimized search
(similar approach to a Binary Search).

The idea is that since we know that left is smaller, and
right is larger - we can reduce the amount of nodes we look through
every iteration exponentially (we cut in half every step).

Another thing to note is that some BST implementations do allow duplicate
elements, however, it's not very common since there's no benefit of
including duplicate elements.

----------------------------
Example
----------------------------

Consider this tree structure:

            5
       _____|_____
      |           |
      4           7
   ___|        ___|___
  |           |       |
  3           6       8

- It satisfies the binary tree definition where there is only one path
between each node, and that there are no cycles.

- There are also N nodes (6), but only N-1 edges (5)

- Also satisfies the BST invariant as we can see that the left subtree has
smaller elements, and the right subtree has larger elements.

- E.g. in the second row, we see that 4 belongs in the left subtree because
4 < 5, and 7 belongs in the right subtree because 7 > 5.

- In the third row, 3 < 4, so belongs in 4's left subtree. 6 < 7, so belongs
in 7's left subtree. 8 > 7, so belongs in 7's right subtree.

Key Definitions
----------------------------

Child
------
"A child is a node extending from another node." - William Fiset

Parent
-------
"A parent is the inverse of a child node" - William Fiset

Essentially, the node that the child is connected/extending from
is the parent node.

larger elements." - William Fiset
